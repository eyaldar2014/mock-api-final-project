    const Project!


function projectPlanning (idea) {
  
  const result = "awesome"


This project has both back-end and front-end. 
Front-end will be writen using React, Css and JS.
Back-end will be based on mongoDB using mongoose, on NodeJS.

The idea is a mock api: it offers itself to the users as a server, including server actions: 
start your own api with collections, passwords and validations.

MusTo Have:
The purpose of the back-end is to be secured, and offer itself as first basically with an option to Register, and have your own end-point(probably with Routes).

NiceTo Have:
And idealy(depends on development time), to offer as similar experience as any mockApi system.

Stages:
- planning widely (all parts, especially unknown)
- planning deeply(all steps)
- const times (schedule)

Key goals:
- add tests
- commit to Github often
- clear code with notes
- quick design (possibly with external libraries)

------------------------------------

## section 1 :  planning widely (all parts, especially unknown) :

- design idea (draw)
- basic components
- mongo endpoint
- authentication // unknown
- user register and login (with credentials) // unknown
- basic interface with mockApi functionality (must to have) // unknown
- design

* verify key points (tests. Github, code notes, avoid design margin)

------------------------------------

## section 2 :  planning deeply: (all steps)

- design idea (draw) :

      - draw pages, components and concepts.

      - understand mockApi idea (project core) :
        - design backend
        - authentication
        - link to front
        - User Schema
        - load users data

      - design user functionality :
        - users options
        - security
        - unique end-point
        - API Schema and collections per user
        - load users data (self made API's with data)

- basic components :

      - HOME
      - Register
      - Login
      - Server user's stuff (data, options, guide)
      - Utilities
      - About
      - Contact (form)

- mongo endpoint :

      - Initialize webApp endpoint (users collection)
      - create users endpoints(users data collections)

- authentication // unknown :

      - healthy connection between my app to mongoDB, verification 
      - Users Schema

- user register and login (with credentials) // unknown :

      - all the way to mongoDB // edit after research

- basic interface with mockApi functionality (must to have) // unknown :

      - all the way to mongoDB // edit after research
      - Dinamic Schemas for users?

- design :

      - Nice to have (all functionality must work in UI) // check later

* verify key points (tests. Github, code notes, avoid design margin)

------------------------------------

## section 3 :  const times: (schedule)

    - add now to section 2 ^^

* verify key points (tests. Github, code notes, avoid design margin)
