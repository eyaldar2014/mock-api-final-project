        this is my first fullstack project :)
        <br /><br />
        The idea is a mock api : it offers itself to the users as a server,
        using mongoDB platform. start your own api with collections,
        validations, and unique end-point.
        <br /><br />
        * unique end-point is under development - using outside server to communicate between the 2 databases I use here.

        <br /><br />
        key concepts that were and still important are :
        unit tests, continous upload to github, code notes, avoid design margin
        <br /><br />
        * more tests are under development at the moment
        <br />
        * CI / CD is also under development at the moment (using Jenkins & Docker)

        <br /><br />
