    <h1>mockapi</h1>
    <h2>only if user is logged in </h2>


    1.  design user functionality :


    2.  mongo endpoint :

    - Initialize webApp endpoint (users collection)
    - create users endpoints (users data functionality)
    - healthy connection between my app to mongoDB, verification
    - security :  :
    - unique end-point (collection ? but secured!)
    - users options - next stage - schema


    3.  basic interface with mockApi functionality (must to have) / unknown :

    - Dinamic Schemas and collections for any users
    - user's UI profile - load users data (self made API's with data)
    - Server user's interface (data, options, guide)
